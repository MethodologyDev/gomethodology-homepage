- title: "Can you accommodate food allergies?"
  content: "We can accommodate many food allergies.<br>Our menu is free of gluten, dairy, and refined sugar.<br> Note: many of our items are prepared in facilities that process wheat, soy, peanuts, dairy, and tree nuts. Though we take care to prevent cross-contamination, if you have an extreme allergy please note that cross-contamination is still a possibility with our food.<br> During signup, you'll be able to add Foods to Avoid to your account settings to ensure that menu items with your allergans are never automatically assigned to you. We also flag these items on the menu for you so you don't accidentally add them to your order.<br> We can't accommodate allergies to garlic or onion as these items are used throughout most of the savory menu. Also, most menu items are made with tree nuts, so if you have a tree nut allergy, your options with us will be very limited.<br> If you have questions about our ability to accommodate your food allergies, please email us at help@gomethodology.com so we can discuss whether we'll be able to cook for you."

- title: "Can you accommodate diets like Keto, Paleo, Mediterranean, Pescatarian, or Vegan?"

There is a vegan version of almost every meal.<br>For Keto and Paleo, we don't offer many preset meals that cater to these diets; however, our Mix 'n Match jars work perfectly for these diets. These protein and vegetable jars allow you to assemble meals that fit your diet or meal plan easily"

- title: "Why do you offer subscriptions?"
  content: "Because putting healthy eating on auto-pilot is the best way for busy people to eat clean consistently enough to feel their absolute best every day.

Eating whole, unprocessed foods with ample vegetable variety and in the right portion size, when done consistently, is life changing when part of a lasting lifestyle. You can pause or cancel with one week's notice."
