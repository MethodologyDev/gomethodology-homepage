  content: "I'm beyond impressed with Methodology. After a week's trial I have lost 3 pounds, I am not craving for sugar and junk food, and I do feel different. I never knew food can make such an impact! I found that the meals were tasty and it did not feel like that I was on a diet - plus I learnt some new things such as having apple cider vinegar before every meal, having matcha tea in the morning (was never a big fan but now it's a part of the routine) and can't even tell you how tasty the snack truffles were."

  content: "The quality of the food is AMAZING!  I have done just about every national and local food delivery service and I've been waiting years for Methodology to go national - that said, this entire week exceeded my expectations.  The colors, flavors and ease of preparation - A+."

  content: "Everything I had was so good! I also loved the bento boxes and the utensils. Perfect to bring to the office. Coworkers asked about it and loved the colors. I loved how there was enough room to shake the salad. Lost a couple pounds while feeling good and not feeling like I was depriving myself. I honestly wish I could eat this way all the time."

  content: "The food was so tasty and filling. I loved the protein balls. I was delighted and surprised by how quickly I started feeling better. By the second day I was less bloated, by the third day I felt all around more energized and comfortable, by the end of the week I noticed how much more energy I had in my workouts."

  content: "I have lost ~6 pounds since starting this program and have noticed positive changes in things like my resting pulse, so it IS making the desired difference, and it feels great to know I'm fueling my body with foods that are genuinely healthy."

  content: "As someone who can't have dairy and am on a weight-loss journey, it was so so delightful to be able to do the [Signature] experience. Everything was already portioned out so I didn't have to worry about counting calories or worrying about going over my calorie count of the day. It was also protein dense and kept me full - which was a general concern for me about my weight-loss journey. The food was delicious and it was so nice to just heat up. It cut away a lot of decisions I had to make and that made my mental load so much lighter. I really enjoyed it and would like to purchase it again in the future!"

  content: "The Methodology [Signature Program] experience is unlike anything out there in the food delivery market. You begin to feel the difference especially the second week. I absolutely LOVE this option to get back to a healthy lifestyle. I was never hungry or felt like I needed something more. So much thought has gone into this program."

  content: "I am so loving the food. I'm hoping that my journey with Methodology will help me get to my weight loss goals. Right now it is feeling possible because I don't feel deprived or like I'm on a diet. But rather that I am eating indulgent spa cuisine that a celebrity with a personal chef would have."

  content: "One week of Methodology and I'm a fan. The apple cider vinegar tonics are really nice and I've noticed a big difference in my appetite and preventing a post-meal slump! Highly recommend. The flavors are also diverse and restaurant-grade without the bad oils etc."
