  content: "I feel that I have more energy and clarity of mind in order to improve my habits and discipline needed for my high intensity career and concurrent exercise plan. I am 56 years old, and thanks to Methodology [Transformation Tribe], I feel like a new person with the strength and energy of my old 20-something self! I can run up the stairs with ease again; work out with less soreness and easier muscle recovery; sleep deeply; and get back into shape. I have not been able to lose weight in nearly 10 years between stress and menopause."

  content: "I loved the messaging and emails from Julie, they really provided focus points and reminders along the way that I found useful, especially during the holidays when the opportunity for poor choices abounds! I was able to recall the points Julie made and make improved (though not always perfect) choices along the way and really maximize the experience for myself."

  content: "My experience with Methodology has been transformational. Since beginning the program several months ago, I have lost 32 lbs (3 clothing sizes!), and am continuing to lose weight each week. The food is delicious, nutritious, and satisfying. My energy and wellbeing have increased immensely. I am excited to continue with Methodology for several more months. I have tried many other programs in the past, but have never before had this kind of success."

  content: "Stunned by how much I've lost. I had to trust the process  because the scale was all over the place but it turned out I've already lost more weight to-date than I thought I would over the entire 8 weeks. Also, I've really improved my social eating. Very exciting. Feel really good."

  content: "I have used so many different prepared 'diet food' delivery services and programs over the years and Methodology is in a class by itself. The food is a seemingly impossible combination of super healthy on multiple levels, and absolutely delicious. Julie's daily lessons and the support of the Tribe are key to resetting so many roadblocks to healthy living that many of us don't even know we have. This was an amazing experience that I would do again without question!"

  content: "Great way to get a handle on your health and jumpstart a healthy lifestyle. Wholesome tasty REAL food. Changed mindset of what healthy food looks like. So often you take away food when 'dieting'. Methodology took away no food. I always felt full and was glad that the food was real food."

  content: "I'm finding this program to be such a breeze because the meals are so delicious and satiating! The tips for eating out and ordering in are the game changer for me. I've used them successfully several times now while also seeing ~9 lbs come off! I never expected that I could actually lose serious weight and not be hungry all the time."

  content: "It's worth every penny and you will absolutely lose weight with this easy to stick to program. Don't think twice. Do it. It's so simple and you won't even know that you're on a “diet” because you'll be eating better food than you normally do, and without the hassle of preparing it, while at the same time going through a major mindset adjustment that makes you actually WANT to stick with it and learning tools to make it EASY to stick with it. Julie is a wonderful and welcoming coach and presence. There are no judgements or harsh programs that feel impossible."

  content: "I'd hoped to lose about 10 lbs during TT1 but I wasn't genuinely hopeful; I just wanted to try one more thing before giving up for good. So, to continue having progress during a string of food-heavy work events, unexpected full-time caregiving these last two weeks, and other challenges I thought would upend my progress, feels like a miracle. I still have a lot to learn, but I'm sticking to this path. I feel better and better. And I don't have to struggle or descend into previous disordered eating in order to work toward the body and life I want. I've even set both a next-step weight loss goal and an overall larger goal for this year."

- title: "Jenny A."
  content: "TT1 is less about the food and more about valuing long term discipline over short term comfort. You will learn to reprogram your mind to prioritize being healthy for the rest of your life. Overall, I'm thrilled to lose 15 lbs and feel confident I can lose another 5. It was an amazing reminder that it's never too late and I can be healthy and be happy with my body if I care enough, demonstrate discipline, and make it a priority."
