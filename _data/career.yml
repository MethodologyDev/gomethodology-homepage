  content: "We can accommodate many food allergies.<br>Our menu is free of gluten, dairy, and refined sugar.<br> Note: many of our items are prepared in facilities that process wheat, soy, peanuts, dairy, and tree nuts. Though we take care to prevent cross-contamination, if you have an extreme allergy please note that cross-contamination is still a possibility with our food.<br> During signup, you'll be able to add Foods to Avoid to your account settings to ensure that menu items with your allergans are never automatically assigned to you. We also flag these items on the menu for you so you don't accidentally add them to your order.<br> We can't accommodate allergies to garlic or onion as these items are used throughout most of the savory menu. Also, most menu items are made with tree nuts, so if you have a tree nut allergy, your options with us will be very limited.<br> If you have questions about our ability to accommodate your food allergies, please email us at help@gomethodology.com so we can discuss whether we'll be able to cook for you."
