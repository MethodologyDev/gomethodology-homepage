The amount of research they put into sourcing ingredients from sustainable, organic, and local suppliers is commendable. As a bonus, the food is packaged in reusable glass jars which you can return to the company simply by leaving the box by the door. If you want to treat your body like a temple, Methodology is the way to go!"

While I love to cook, this was just the break and mental load relief that I needed after a busy few weeks. The food was so nutritious, and not having to think and plan around ingredients or prep made this feel absolutely worth it."
