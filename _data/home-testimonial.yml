  content: "Methodology and I were destined to cross paths. I have been thinking about hiring a meal service for a while and never made time for it. I have recently lost 20 pounds and have been focusing on eating healthier. Methodology has allowed me to see that clean eating is possible without the hassle of cooking all the time. Eating clean can taste yummy so do not keep procrastinating on choosing to eat healthy. I wish I would've have had someone that could have guided me I better to understand how clean eating is not as challenging."

  content: "I have now been using Methodology for the better part of this past year following a sudden onset of joint pain, a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, and a clear need to radically change my food intake. I have lost 25 pounds, gained strength, and feel great. Thank you! Thank you so much for nourishing me well and being a part of my healing journey for the past year!"

  content: "I was just trying to eat clean with minimal effort in the last few months prior to my wedding and have managed to lose 5 pounds without trying! I feel great and have been able to increase my vegetable intake and reduce my carb intake."

  content: "I found Methodology looking for an overall healthy lifestyle. I recently fought skin cancer and was not able to be as active as usual or have the energy to cook as much as usual at home. I started eating unhealthy “convenience” food and gained about 10-15 pounds, alongside increased fatigue and depression. Now that my surgeries are over, and along with slowly increasing exercise, I have lost about 10 pounds in one month eating Methodology several days a week. I've found more energy and less depressed moods and found a more positive outlook!"

  content: "I have so much energy and without trying, let me say that again WITHOUT trying, I've lost 18 lbs since starting. Freedom, it gives me a lot of time back to spend with my family and it takes the worry and hassle about picking the right thing to eat."

- title: "Fernando C."
  content: "I've lost 15 lbs due to the calorie portioned meals, not eating out as much and being able to eat a variety of foods without denying myself of treats. So far, the best food delivery company I've found and I get to reuse the jars!"

- title: "Tami W."
  content: "I wish I would've known that it's not as hard as I thought it would be. When the food tastes great, you don't miss the bad things you used to eat. I thought I would die without cheese and carbs, but I barely think about it because the meals I eat are satisfying, I have more energy and less bloating, and I've even lost 5 lbs without trying. I let myself have a cheat day on the weekends, but even then, I find that I'm eating better than I used to because the junk food isn't worth the way my body feels after eating it. I now see how much the food I eat impacts how I feel."

  content: "First off let me start by saying I love your services. I have lost 19lbs by eating your food coupled with a strict work out regime. I have been so impressed at the variety and flavors of the meals."
