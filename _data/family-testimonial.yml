I never thought that day would come! My 17 year old son LOVES your food as well! The fact that you use glass jars and are eco-conscious is the icing on the cake."

We have become totally hooked on the flavors, whole-health benefits and the convenience of each family member choosing what they want. We have even started sharing and sampling with our oldest daughter who's just over 2 years old. We love it so much we have recommended it to all our friends and we know of at least four households that have started using Methodology because we talk about it so much."

I've got all his food made farmers market fresh, and then take out or protein bars. Keep trying food deliveries and yours is the first that I am in love with. It also helps that my little guy went bonkers for the chicken meatballs and cauliflower cakes this week. More than one picnic on the kitchen floor with both of us enjoying your delicious food. I usually don't stay past an intro week... I'm in!"
