  content: "I have delt with problematic skin, bloating, and fatigue for years. After learning how to fast and eat clean the right way, it has changed my life! I feel differently and have new glow that I have never had. I have tried multiple food delivery services and this one is by far the best! So much flavor and the perfect amount of variation that I keep coming back for more."

  content: "The food was ABSOLUTELY delightful. Such amazing flavor, everything stayed fresh.. I looked forward to eating every meal. The bento boxes to keep were surprising and welcomed! It was also delightful how I never had to think about what I was eating that day."

  content: "I feel like over the past 19 months I have gained a lot of knowledge from Methodology on how to nourish myself. My palate has evolved towards healthy food thanks to the service. My cholesterol has stabilized and I have gone off the care of a cardiologist. I want to take full accountability for feeding myself and preparing foods. I love Methodology - the food, the brand, and the CEO/leadership."

Its so nice to have a healthy meal waiting for me and I love the variety. I also have noticed less bloating, cravings, and my skin continues to clear up."

  content: "The best meal delivery service I've ever experienced! Most of my friends know that I rarely like to eat other's cooking and prefer to cook for myself or go to favorite dine out locations - this program is the exception for me, I'd eat this over my own cooking - which is a first."

  content: "Like many who struggle with chronic conditions, I never knew I could change my symptoms through food. Everyone always told me different things about food and expected me to eat differently. I wish I knew that junk food had a cumulative effect on your body inside and out and had Methodology to help me break free from bad habits and sugar addiction. Methodology is taking care of me so I have more space to live my life."

  content: "I have broken some bad habits with Methodology. I feel so much better, lighter, and less bloated. This is the first step to losing weight and changing your life from the foundation. It's not a crash diet. It's made me not eat a sandwich or pizza for a month and I don't even care which is insane!"
