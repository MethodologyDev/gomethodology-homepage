  content: "I was pleasantly surprised with Methodology - the meals had unique delicious flavors that made eating healthy easy. Speaking of easy, when you have a crying infant and literally 5 minutes to prepare dinner this was a godsend. We would have ended up probably eating pizza everyday out of desperation and time constraints had we not had meals we were looking forward to in the refrigerator just waiting to be warmed up. After about a month with Methodology (and 6 weeks post-partum) I've lost over 2/3 of the baby weight and feel confident that I'll be able to lose the last 1/3 no problem. I really enjoy the meals and feel great about the choice to join when we did. "

  content: "Methodology is the best thing that happened to my husband and me as new parents. My husband works more than full time and as a full-time mom without a nanny, we rely on the service for three dinners a week. The food is healthy and delicious. We are satisfied and will continue to use the service."
